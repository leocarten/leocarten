## 👋 Hi there  

I'm Leo, a computer scientist with an interest in Full Stack development and machine learning!

## ✏️ About me

I have been programming for 5 year, both through my Bachelors degree in Computer Science (where I have earned a **3.81 GPA**), and also because of my interests outside of school. I would certainly say that majority of my knowledge has come outside of the classroom, purely driven by my curiousity and interests.

I have 1 year of **professional experience** where I interned as a UI/UX developer at Aclara Technologies. I helped build a Desktop Application which was written in Python. The goal of the Desktop App was to streamline the process for my co-workers and reduce manual labor.

## 🚀 What am I currently working on?

I am currently building out a mobile application called CampusCrush! CampusCrush is written in React Native, uses a Node.js API that I configured which is currently being hosted on an AWS EC2 instance. The application uses a MySQL database. My application also has a built-in **neural network** that is programmed using the [brain.js](https://brain.js.org/#/) library. 

I am very excited about this project, and I have loved developing it so far!
